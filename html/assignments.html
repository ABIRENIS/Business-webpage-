    <h1>SUMMER</h1>

    <div class="Paragraph"> 
    <p> Of all the six seasons, my favourite season is <span class="highlight">summer</span>. It is the hottest season of the year. The <span class="highlight">summer</span>summer season starts in March and ends in June. In this season the sun shines brightly. The best part of this season is <span class="highlight">summer </span>vacation. This is a great relief from a hectic schedule, home works, and exam pressure. I enjoy the vacation by going to a beach or a hill station with friends and families. In  <span class="highlight">summer</span> I like to have cold drinks, lassi, ice cream, and coconut water.
We get many fruits in this season like mango, watermelon, litchi, jackfruit, pineapple etc. Many festivals such as charak puja, Rama Navami, Baisakhi, Rabindra Jayanti, etc. are celebrated in this season. There are varieties of fruits and vegetables available during this season. Many beautiful flowers like Lilly, Marigold, Roses, Dahlia, and Sunflower bloom in this season. <span class="highlight">Summer</span> is just a wonderful season with so much fun and enjoyment.</p>

<h1> A Rainy Day Paragraph</h1></div>
<div class="Paragraph"><p> India is a land of seasons. Six seasons come and pass away here. Autumn, however, appears to me the most charming season of all. It covers roughly two months-September and October. Our earth looks fresh and bright with its coming. The cloudy sky and the rainy weather are over in autumn. A deep blue sky smiles and the sun shines brightly. Nature is adorned with grace and charms. The natural beauty of the season is greatly appealing to me.
Autumn is dear to me for another important reason. This is the season for the greatest Bengali festival-the Durga Puja. This is the festival of joy and happiness. It makes one happy. I enjoy in it the happiness of the season</p>
